# Three.js Journey

This repository collects my exercises and personal variations from the **Three.js Journey** course by Bruno Simon.  
Each lesson lives in its own folder and is deployed individually with Vercel.

> ⚠️ This repo contains _my own implementations and experiments_ based on the course.  
> To follow the original course, visit [Bruno Simon's official website](https://threejs-journey.com).
